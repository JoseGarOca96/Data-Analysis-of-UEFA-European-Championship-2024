The UEFA Euro 2024 tournament just finished, and it was an amazing event. It gave me the idea to gather players/match stats and put them into datasets. 
I cleaned the datasets and uploaded them to PostgreSQL to analyze player performance, award the best players of the tournament, and more. 
I love the sport, and being able to watch the tournament was an exciting experience. Combining my passion for data analytics and soccer (football) will be a great experience.
